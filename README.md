# parking-detection
In this project, we developed a real-time parking spot detection system that uses a deep neural network. This model predicts and localizes vacant and occupied parking spots in videos and images captured from recording devices. To detect multiple parking spots in real time we used Single Shot Multibox Detection (SSD).
